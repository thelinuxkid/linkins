TODO
====

- Fail gracefully when creating, linking and removing files and dirs
- Add a "clean" option to remove links that have been installed
- Add a way to copy some files and link others (or let user handle
  this with scripts)
- Allow for different configurations using a file called
  linkins-versions which dictates which files in the directory should
  be included in the specified version, if any, e.g., server version
  versus laptop version
